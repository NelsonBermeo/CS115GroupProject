# CS115GroupProject

This project was my biggest piece of art to date, topping even the scrabble homework. I was the team leader of the group and drove our ship through mud, ice, and hurricanes until we arrived to completion! 

# What

My name is Nelson Bermeo and I am a CS freshman at Stevens Instiute of Technology. This was a two week project that had four people working to create a music reccomender text interactive program that would perform multiple functions to manipulate and showcase data. My professor is Erisa Teroli. We utilized the ideas from the textbook CS For All by Christine A, Zachary D, Geoff K, and Ran LH.

# What I learned
- I learned how to optimize a method that checks two lists for similar data. You know when you can just have a nested loop with for i in something if i in something else then blah blah. Well when working with big data, that code will be slow because you'd have to go through a whole list for every index in another list. Instead, the textbook showed me a way to compare lists with a while loop with two sorted lists and incrementing indexes. The idea was that if something from one list was smaller than another and if it looks in that other list but the index there is greater than that smaller index then we don't have to conitnue checking because the list is sorted.
- I used the new optimization here to create a similar method but for "not in"
